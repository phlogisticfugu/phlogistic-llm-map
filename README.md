# [phlogistic-llm-map](https://phlogisticfugu.github.io/phlogistic-llm-map/)

Data-driven visualization of major Large Language Models (LLMs)
- continuously update-able via pull-request (submissions welcome)
- links to source information about models
- cross-referenced by the publishing entity
- circle sizes correspond to number of citations

## methodology:

- preprint URLs used as "authoritative" paper where available, blog URLs used as fallback.
This space is moving quickly, so not all papers have been published in a peer-reviewed journal.
- dates chosen are the "first submission" dates for each model
- model lineage is approximate, based on what is referenced in the papers
- defining a major model as one that seems to have a lot of people talking about it (citations and/or buzz)
- number of citations pulled manually from Google Scholar (potentially to automate later)
