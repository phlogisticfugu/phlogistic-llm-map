### Data-driven visualization of major Large Language Models (LLMs):
- continuously update-able models (because new ones are being created all the time. contributions welcome)
- links to source information about models
- cross-referenced by the publishing entity
- circle sizes correspond to number of citations

### methodology:

- preprint URLs used as "authoritative" paper where available, blog URLs used as fallback
This space is moving quickly, so not all papers have been published in a peer-reviewed journal
- model dates are the "first submission" dates for each model
- model lineage is approximate, based on what is referenced in the papers
- including "major" models = models that seem to have a lot of people talking about it (citations and/or buzz)
- number of citations pulled manually from Google Scholar
